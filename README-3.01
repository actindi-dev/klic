	    =============================================

This version of KLIC is essentially a maintenance release of
klic-3.003 (official version released from ICOT and JIPDEC) and
its extension, klic-3.005 (developed at Waseda University by
Hiroshi Igarashi, Yusuke Takagi, Ryo Matsumura and Yusuke Kaneki).

It contains a sequential core and a distributed-memory parallel
implementation.  It is known to work on

- Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 with GCC 5.3.0, 4.3.0-Gentoo with GCC 4.9.4,
  CentOS release 6.7 with GCC 4.4.7),
- Mac OS X version 10.11.4 (El-Capitan) with GCC 6.1.0 and
  LLVM 7.3.0 (see Note below), and
- Cygwin (32-bit) version 2.5.1-1 with GCC 5.3.0.

Despite its name, the distributed-memory parallel implementation runs
perfectly on recent SMP (symmetric multiprocessor) systems as well as
single-processor systems with multi-core CPUs.

Please see README or README.j (Japanese) for the rest of the
introduction, which is still valid except for hardware-specific
information and contact addresses.

Detailed installation procedure can be found in INSTALL and INSTALL.j
(Japanese).  This distribution includes configuration files containing
typical settings for several OSes (config.sh.*).  We'd suggest copying
one of them to config.sh, making changes to library paths etc. (if
necessary), and run "./Configure".

  Note: for Mac OS X Darwin, LLVM 7.0-7.3 with -O2 may not properly
  compile C files generated from KLIC.  In this case, please use -O1
  to compile C files generated from KLIC (see and use the setting of
  DEF_KLICCFLAGS in config.sh.MacOSX).  Alternatviely, you can
  download GNU GCC from http://hpc.sourceforge.net/ or elsewhere and
  use it.

Implementation details of KLIC can be found in the (revived) document
"Inside KLIC" (in documents/inside).  Detailed changelog can be found
in ChangeLog.  Compiler developers may need to consult FOR-DEVELOPERS
or FOR-DEVELOPERS.j.
